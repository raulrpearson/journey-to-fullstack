## Security

- [This article](https://www.rdegges.com/2018/please-stop-using-local-storage/)
  makes some good points agains using Local Storage for any sensitive
  information, including JWTs used for authentication. It suggests a great
  pattern for sensitive info storage (encrypted cookies). It also recommends
  IndexedDB API to store non-sensitive non-stringy data in the browser. In
  summary, only use Local Storage for non-sensitive, low performance, smaller
  than 5MB string data.
