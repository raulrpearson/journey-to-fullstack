# Tools

- [Semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
  automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next
  version number, generating the release notes and publishing the package. This
  removes the immediate connection between human emotions and version numbers,
  strictly following the Semantic Versioning specification.
- [Editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) helps maintain consistent coding
  styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various
  editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for
  defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable
  editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files
  are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

  where he spoke about the motivation and decisions that went into creating Git,
  as well as trust in open source projects.

### Understanding `upstream`

GitHub tells you to use `git push -u origin master`. [This SO
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37770744) gives some insight into what
upstream is and why that is required.

Some of my takeaways:

- An upstream is simply another branch name, usually a remote-tracking branch,
  associated with a (regular, local) branch.
- Each branch can have 0 or 1 upstream.
- Setting an upstream is convenient becaues then many git commands can be used
  without arguments to produce expected results (i.e. `fetch`, `merge`,
  `rebase`, `pull`, `status`)
- `push` = `fetch` followed by `merge` or `rebase`

## JavaScript module and package managers

- Understand and write about npm, npx, ncu, package.json, etc.
- Understand npm audit results
- Understand how to create a package.json from scratch
- yarn workspaces and monorepos
- Check out [Pika](https://www.pikapkg.com/about/). Pika's mission is to make
  modern JavaScript more accessible by making it easier to find, publish,
  install, and use modern packages on npm.
- Lerna
- Check out [yalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc). Better workflow than
  npm/yarn link for package authors.

### Publishing on npm

This [article from
Freecodecamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-a-beautiful-tiny-npm-package-and-publish-it-2881d4307f78)
goes over the least possible work from zero to published package. In summary:

1. Put your code inside a folder. The `package.json` in that folder should
   have a name and version at the very least.
2. Create an account on npm and log in using the command line: `npm adduser` or
   `npm login`.
3. Publish with `npm publish` or `npm publish --access=public` if you've used a
   scoped package name, since scoped packages are published privately by
   default (and you need a paid account to publish privately).

Some additional notes:

- Those steps will get you from zero to published, but there's a bit more that
  you'd typically want to do: add a README, a LICENSE, more fields to the
  `package.json` files, badges to your README file, an .npmignore file, etc.

- Understand [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) so that you can assign
  versions correctly. Note that you can use `npm version [major|minor|patch]` to
  update your `package.json` from the command line. The command has more options,
  check them out.

- Understand [package scoping](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) in case you
  want to use that feature.

- [Understand](https://blog.greenkeeper.io/one-simple-trick-for-javascript-package-maintainers-to-avoid-breaking-their-user-s-software-and-to-6edf06dc5617) [`npm dist-tag`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) and how to
  use `npm publish --tag=<tag-name>`. When you publish, npm puts that new
  version on the `latest` tag by default. If you're maintaining different major
  versions of your package, this could create problems for your users. If you
  publish a patch for your 3.x version, your users will install that instead of
  your latest 4.x. Learn how to use tags to manage this. You could have `next`
  for a 5.x work in progress, `latest` for your stable up to date 4.x work and
  `3.x-latest` for maintenance.

### Developing an npm package

The short version: use [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html). But
if you need to test preinstall/postinstall hooks for your package, `npm link`
wonâ€™t run those hooks, so [you
do](https://medium.com/@the1mills/how-to-test-your-npm-module-without-publishing-it-every-5-minutes-1c4cb4b369be):

```bash
npm install /absolute/local/path/to/your/other/package
```

Note that `npm link` creates a symlink to `<your-package>` in the global space,
and then when you call npm link viking from `<your-project>`, it creates a
symlink not directly to `<your-package>`, but rather to the global symlink. This
is an important differences if you are using different global Node.js versions,
e.g., NVM. `npm install /absolute/path/viking` will alter `package.json`, `npm link` does not.

around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.

## Bundlers

In the context of web applications, bundlers are tools that transform your
source files to make them optimized for deployment. I think that mainly means
smaller size and less network requests, but it also includes things like
managing the transformation of things like SASS (good to have in development)
into CSS (required in deployment).

These are some popular bundlers:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)

Here's a
[comparison](https://medium.com/js-imaginea/comparing-bundlers-webpack-rollup-parcel-f8f5dc609cfd)
of Webpack, Parcel and Rollup. I'm currently debating myself between Webpack and
Parcel. Webpack is everywhere, but Parcel seems to provide a better DX. I think
I'll try to focus on Parcel for now and be ready to move to Webpack depending of
how they both evolve.

Some of the features to understand bundlers:

- Configuration. I honestly don't see what the big deal is, but it is nice to
  have as zero-config as possible. It seems Parcel provides the lowest config
  requirement.

- Entry points. Where does the bundler start parsing to do it's thing. I like
  that parcel provides an `index.html` entry point out of the box.

- Transformations. SASS to CSS, for example. Added with plugins. Again, Parcel
  seems to handle the most without plugins.

- Tree shaking. Eliminating dead code. Not supported by Parcel yet.

- Dev server. Watching for changes to your source files and automatically
  rebuilding your bundles.

- Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Being able to reload parts of your running app
  without having to reload the whole app. Speeds up development.

- Code splitting. Creating bundles that are broken up into different parts.
  Improves UX by requiring a smaller initial download. The user can start using
  the app while the rest of it is being fetched in the background.
