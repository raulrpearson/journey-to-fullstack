# JS Algorithms And Data Structures Certification

Notes from following freeCodeCamp's JS algorithms and data structures cert.

## Basic JavaScript

- Check out the assortment of [assignment
  operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment_Operators#Overview).
  I typically only use `+=` and never think of using the rest!

- Characters in string are immutable. The strings themselves are not. So you can
  change the value of a whole string (`s = 'new value'`), you can read single
  characters with bracket notation (`let t = s[2]`), but you cannot change a single
  character in an existing string (`s[2] = 'a' // not!`).

- Become more fluent with [array
  methods](https://javascript.info/array-methods#summary): `push`, `pop`, `shift`,
  `unshift`, `splice`, `slice`, `concat`, `forEach`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`,
  `includes`, `find`, `findIndex`, `filter`, `map`, `sort`, `reverse`, `split`,
  `join`, `reduce`, `reduceRight`, `isArray`.

- Assigning a value to an undeclared variable [implicitly creates
  it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#Description)
  as a global variable (it becomes a property of the global object) when the
  assignment is executed. The differences between declared and undeclared
  variables are:

  1. Declared variables are constrained in the execution context in which they
     are declared. Undeclared variables are always global.

  2. Declared variables are created before any code is executed. Undeclared
     variables do not exist until the code assigning to them is executed.

  3. Declared variables are a non-configurable property of their execution context
     (function or global). Undeclared variables are configurable (e.g. can be
     deleted).

- Study scopes.

- Understand coercion and different behavior between `==` vs `===` and `!=` `!==`.

- Review [`switch` syntax and patterns](https://javascript.info/switch).

## ES6

- It seems that `'use strict';` at the top of your files or the start of
  functions is recommended. It's rather annoying to have to write that every time,
  don't you think? Javascript.info has a good succinct [article on how to use
  strict mode](https://javascript.info/strict-mode).

  I've also found some recommendations warning that if your code is processed by
  some build system (minification, concatenation...), you might have unexpected
  results when mixing strict and sloppy scripts. One solution is to `'use strict';` at the [start of
  functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strict-mode-javascript/). Another
  problem to consider is that if your code is executed in older browsers, they
  might not support strict mode and you might get unexpected results as well.
  Preventing problems in this scenario would require careful testing.

- In JavaScript, [`const` does not mean
  constant](https://mariusschulz.com/blog/constant-variables-in-javascript-or-when-const-isnt-constant),
  but one-time assignment. **But**, the part that's constant is the reference to
  an object stored within the constant variable, not the object itself.

  ```javascript
  const settings = {
    baseUrl: 'https://example.com'
  };

  settings = {}; // fail!
  settings.baseUrl = 'https://evil.example.com'; // win!
  ```

  <!-- TODO: spacing between this code block and the next paragraph is not good -->

  Declaring a variable to be constant doesn't make the objects it references
  immutable. Object properties can change or be deleted altogether. The same
  goes for arrays assigned to a constant variable; Elements can be added,
  removed, reordered, or modified.

  To make an object truly immutable, you can pass it to the
  [`Object.freeze`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze)
  function to prevent any changes to its properties. Be aware that freeze is
  shallow, so you'll have to recursively call it for nested objects if you want
  the entire object tree to be frozen. If you need immutable data structures, it
  might be safer and more convenient to use a library such as Facebook's
  [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) which is specifically
  made for this purpose.

- An [arrow function
  expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
  is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression,
  although without its own bindings to the this, arguments, super, or new.target
  keywords.

  Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used
  as constructors. Arrow functions are always anonymous. Two factors influenced
  the introduction of arrow functions: shorter functions and non-binding of
  this. An arrow function does not have its own `this`; the `this` value of the
  enclosing execution context is used.

- Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments
  or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. Eloquent JavaScript has
  a great article on [higher-order
  functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html).

- I always forget that I can declare function parameters with default values.
  Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with
  default values if no value or `undefined` is passed:

  ```javascript
  function multiply(a, b = 1) {
    return a * b;
  }
  ```

- I use [destructuring
  assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
  regularly, but I rarely reach out for new names and default values:

  ```javascript
  let o = { p: 42, q: true };
  let { p, q } = o; // basic
  let { p: foo, q: bar } = o; // new names
  let { q = false, r = 'hi' } = o; // default values
  let { p: foo = 1, q, r: bar = 'hi' } = o; // combined
  ```

- I haven't written much code using classes in JavaScript. [JavaScript
  classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes),
  introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's
  existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new
  object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript. JavaScript.info [article on
  classes](https://javascript.info/class) is quite good.

  In summary, the basic class syntax looks like this:

  ```javascript
  class MyClass {
    prop = value;

    constructor(...) {
      // ...
    }

    method(...) {}

    get something(...) {}
    set something(...) {}

    [Symbol.iterator]() {}
    // ...
  }
  ```

  `MyClass` is technically a function. Methods are written to
  `MyClass.prototype`.

## Regular Expressions

- Use regular expressions with many methods. [Popular
  ones](https://javascript.info/regexp-methods#recipes) are:

  - `str.match(regExp)`
  - `regExp.test(str)`
  - `str.replace(regExp, newStr|fun)`

- Match literals like this `/hello/`

- Provide alternatives like this `/yes|no|maybe/`

- Flags go at the end of the regular expression like this `/regex/flags`.
  The two most popular flags are: `i` for case insensitive search and `g` for
  global search.

- `.` matches any character except newline, but can be made to include newline
  with the `s` flag.

- Use square brackets to define character sets: `/[abc]/` would be equivalent to
  `/a|b|c/`, if I'm not mistaken. Use `-` to define ranges. Use `[^...]` to
  define a character set by specifying its complement. I.e. `[^abc]` matches
  everything _except_ `a`, `b` or `c`.

- For frequently used character sets, shorthand _character classes_ exist. The
  most popular:

  - `\w` equivalent to `[A-Za-z0-9_]` and `\W` its complement
  - `\d` equivalent to `[0-9]` and `\D` its complement
  - `\s` equivalent to `[ \r\t\f\n\v]` and `\S` its complement.

- Quantifiers establish whether a given character or group can repeat itself:

  - `?` 0 or 1 times
  - `*` 0 or more times
  - `+` 1 or more times
  - `{n}` exactly n times
  - `{min,max}` a number of times in between min and max (inclusive). Either min
    or max can be omitted.

- `^` at the beginning of the regular expression denotes beginning of string.
  `$` at the end denotes end of string.

- Lookaheads establish an extra condition without becoming part of the match.
  Positive lookahead `x(?=y)` matches `x` when followed by `y`. Negative lookahead
  `x(?!y)` matches `x` when _not_ followed by `y`.

- Note that `^` and `?` mean different things depending on where they're used.

- By default, regular expressions behave in a _greedy_ manner. For example,
  `/t[a-z]*i/` applied to `"titanic"` will produce the biggest match,
  `"titani"`. By adding a question mark like so `/t[a-z]*?i/`, the match behaves
  in a lazy manner and the smallest match is returned `"ti"`.

- Create capture groups by using parenthesis `(...)`, which can be referenced
  subsequently inside the regular expression by number `\1`, `\2`, etc. They can
  also be referenced in `replace` like so `$1`, `$2`, etc.

## Debugging

- Three types of bugs:
  - syntax errors that prevent a program from running,
  - runtime errors when code fails to execute or has unexpected behavior, and
  - semantic (or logical) errors when code doesn't do what it's meant to.

## Object Oriented Programming

- An object is just a data structure that holds property/value pairs. The values
  can be of any arbitrary type: strings, numbers, objects... When a property has a
  value of type Function, we call it a method.

- Constructors are functions that create new objects. They follow a few
  conventions:

  - They are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other
    functions that are not constructors.

  - They use the keyword `this` to set properties of the object they will
    create. Inside the constructor, `this` refers to the new object it will
    create.

  - They define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other
    functions might.

- You can use `obj instanceof Obj` to test if a specific `obj` object is an
  instance of the `Obj` constructor.

- An object has two types of properties: _own_ properties and _prototype_
  properties. Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself.
  And prototype properties are defined on the prototype. `.hasOwnProperties(key)`
  returns `false` for prototype properties, but the `in` operator works with
  both. But it's more complicated, so check [Enumerability and ownership of
  properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties)

  > Enumerable properties are those properties whose internal enumerable flag is
  > set to true, which is the default for properties created via simple assignment
  > or via a property initializer (properties defined via Object.defineProperty
  > and such default enumerable to false). Enumerable properties show up in
  > for...in loops unless the property's key is a Symbol. Ownership of properties
  > is determined by whether the property belongs to the object directly and not
  > to its prototype chain. Properties of an object can also be retrieved in
  > total.

- Manually setting the prototype of a new object will erase (overwrite, I guess)
  the constructor property. One solution is to include the constructor in the
  object literal we're using to overwrite `prototype`.

  ```javascript
  function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Modify the code below this line
  Dog.prototype = {
    constructor: Dog,
    numLegs: 2,
    eat: function() {
      console.log('nom nom nom');
    },
    describe: function() {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    }
  };
  ```

## Functional programming

- Functional programming is about:

  - Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program,
    which includes global variables that are subject to change

  - Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

  - Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the
    state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

- Functions passed as arguments are referred to as _callbacks_.

- Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or
  returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called
  _first class_ functions. All functions are first class in JavaScript.

- Functions that take functions as arguments or return functions are called
  _higher order_ functions. The functions that are passed as arguments or
  returned as results are called _lambdas_.

- In functional programming, changing or altering things is called _mutation_,
  and the outcome is called a _side effect_. A function, ideally, should be a
  _pure function_, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

- Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your
  dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or
  object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the
  function as an argument.

- `reduce` caveat: the first time the callback is called, `accumulator` and
  `currentValue` can be one of two values. If `initialValue` is provided in the call
  to `reduce()`, then `accumulator` will be equal to `initialValue`, and `currentValue`
  will be equal to the first value in the array. If no `initialValue` is provided,
  then `accumulator` will be equal to the first value in the array, and `currentValue`
  will be equal to the second.

- Check out the
  [`every`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every)
  and
  [`some`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some)
  methods!
