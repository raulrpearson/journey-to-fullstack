# APIs and Microservices Certification

This are my notes. They're not meant to be exhaustive, just to include the
things that I found new or interesting.

## Managing packages with NPM

- Use `~` tilde to allow patch version updates. Use `^` caret to allow minor
  (and patch) version updates. Since minor versions shouldn't break API, using
  caret is the default behavior when installing packages.

## Basic Node and Express

- Express provides routing capabilities like so `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`. For
  example: `app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hi!'))`

- In Node.js,
  [`__dirname`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules_dirname)
  is the directory name of the current module. It's required for example with
  `res.sendFile`.

- In Express, you add middleware with `app.use(...)`. Middleware functions
  intercept requests at specified routes in order to introduce some desired
  processing or side-effects.

- An interesting middleware is `express.static(<path>)` to serve static assets
  on a given path.

- Middleware functions take 3 arguments: the request object, the response
  object, and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

- Middleware can be mounted on a specific route and can also be chained within a
  route definition.

- Use `req.params` and `req.query` for input taken out of the URL.

- A syntax that allows you to chain different verb handlers on the same path
  route: `app.route(<path>).get(<handler>).post(<handler>)`
