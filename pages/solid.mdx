# Solid

[Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/) (Social Linked Data) is a web decentralization
project led by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. The project:

> aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in
> true data ownership as well as improved privacy

by developing a platform for linked-data applications that are completely
decentralized and fully under users' control rather than controlled by other
entities.

Solid's central focus is to enable the discovery and sharing of information in a
way that preserves privacy. A user stores personal data in "pods" (personal
online data stores) hosted wherever the user desires. Applications that are
authenticated by Solid are allowed to request data if the user has given the
application permission.

A user may distribute personal information among several pods; for example,
different pods might contain personal profile data, contact information,
financial information, health, travel plans, or other information. The user
could then join an authenticated social-networking application by giving it
permission to access appropriate information in a specific pod.

The user retains complete ownership and control of data in the user's pods: what
data each pod contains, where each pod is stored, and which applications have
permission to use the data.

## Philosophy

In ["Paradigm shifts for the decentralized
Web"](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/),
Ruben Verborgh lays out several interesting ideas:

> In this blog post, I will discuss three paradigm shifts we need to prepare for
> if we want to build Web applications with a decentralized mindset:

> 1. End users become data owners. This is the most well-known decentralization
>    aspect: we store our data in places of our choice, which improves privacy and
>    control.

> 2. Apps become views. As apps become decoupled from data, they start acting
>    as interchangeable views rather than the single gateway to that data.

> 3. Interfaces become queries. Data will be distributed across highly diverse
>    interfaces, so sustainable apps need declarative contracts instead of custom
>    data requests.

> [...]

> The main challenge with full decentralization of data is scalability. In the
> Mastodon scenario, there are still relatively few servers for many users. In the
> Solid scenario, there might even be more data pods than users. In the end,
> decentralization will go hand in hand with dynamic data replication, which will
> need to be balanced carefully with fine-grained access control possibilities in
> order to guarantee data privacy.

> [...]

> In contrast, decentralized Web applications decouple data and applications:
> you enter data only once—in your own data pod. Instead of maintaining
> credentials with each app, you log in through your data pod and give apps
> permission to read or write specific parts of your data. The Web’s ecosystem
> thereby evolves from bundled data+service packages into applications as
> interchangeable views, wherein each Web app provides consistent visualizations,
> interactions, and processing over your personal data pod. Furthermore, those
> apps let you interact with any other data pods you have access to, such as those
> of your friends. Applications ask rather than own, and they are able to reuse
> data create by other apps, avoiding vendor lock-in.

> [...]

> The combination of decentralization and query execution also confronts us with
> a temporally different way of interacting with data. In traditional Web
> applications, the procedure is typically “send query—wait for execution to
> complete—act on all results”. In a decentralized setting, we know that data
> collection will take time, so applications should be prepared to do more useful
> things instead of just waiting. The procedure becomes “send query—act on each
> incoming result”, processing every piece of incoming data a streaming way. In
> general, completeness should never be assumed, given that the Web is an open
> world. This is an additional indication of how radically the relation between
> data and applications will change.

## Specification overview

[Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/intro-to-solid-spec) is a proposed set of
conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on
[Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) principles. Solid
is modular and extensible. It relies as much as possible on existing W3C
standards and protocols.

- **Identity**: Solid uses
  [WebID](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/identity/) URIs as
  universal usernames or actor identifiers. WebIDs provide globally unique
  decentralized identifiers, enable cross-service federated signin, prevent
  service provider lock-in, and give users control over their own identity.

- **Profiles**: the WebID URI's primary function is to point to the location of a
  public WebID Profile Document. Solid uses these for management of user identity
  and security credentials (such as public keys), and user preferences
  discovery. Profiles are used by many actor types like users, groups,
  organizations, devices and software applications.

  A WebID URI, when dereferenced, yields a WebID Profile Document in a Linked
  Data format (Turtle by default, but often available as JSON-LD or HTML+RDFa).
  Parsing this document provides a client application with useful information,
  such as the user's name and profile image, links to user preferences and
  related documents, and lists of public key certificates or other relevant
  identity credentials.

  See component spec: [Solid WebID Profiles
  Specification](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/solid-webid-profiles.md).

- **Authentication**: the process of determining a user’s identity. Applications
  usually manage authentication with usernames and passwords as well as a recovery
  mechanism using typically email.

  Solid currently uses
  [WebID-TLS](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/) as its primary
  authentication mechanism. Alternative complementary mechanisms are also being
  actively investigated. In addition, Solid recommends that server
  implementations also offer secondary authentication available for users for
  Account Recovery (via email or some other out-of-band mechanism).

  See component spec: [Solid WebID-TLS
  Specification](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/authn-webid-tls.md).

  The Solid team is currently implementing support for WebID-OIDC as another
  primary authentication mechanism. It is based on the OAuth2/OpenID Connect
  protocols, adapted for WebID based decentralized use cases.

  See component spec: [WebID-OIDC
  Specification](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec).

  There are several other authentication mechanisms that are currently being
  investigated, such as combinations of traditional username-and-password
  authentication and WebID-TLS Delegation.

  Regardless of the primary authentication mechanism, bearer tokens and other
  proofs of identity tend to get lost by users. Passwords can be forgotten,
  browser certificates can be lost to hardware failure, and so on. Solid
  recommends that secondary Account Recovery mechanisms are provided by server
  implementers, to aid in these scenarios.

- **Authorization and access control**: the process of deciding whether a user
  has access to a particular resource. Solid currently uses the Web Access
  Control (WAC) mechanism for cross-domain authorization for all its resources.

  See component spec: [Solid WAC
  Specification](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec).

- **Content representation**: Solid deals with reading and writing two kinds of
  resources: Linked Data resources (RDF in the form of JSON-LD, Turtle, HTML+RDFa,
  etc.) and everything else (binary data and non-linked-data structured text).
  you can build Solid applications with non-linked data resources, using actual
  RDF-based Linked Data provides you with considerable benefits in terms of
  interoperability with the rest of the Solid app ecosystem.

  See component spec: [Solid Content
  Representation](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/content-representation.md).

- **Reading and writing resources**: Solid extends the [Linked Data
  Platform](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) spec to provide a simple REST API for CRUD
  operations on resources and containers. Solid also provides a WebSockets based
  API for a PubSub (Publish/Subscribe) mechanism, through which clients can be
  notified in real time of changes affecting a give resource.

  See component spec: [HTTPS REST
  API](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/api-rest.md).

  See component spec: [WebSockets
  API](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/api-websockets.md).

- **Social web app protocols**: Solid provides a number of specs and
  recommendations to help developers achieve interoperability between various
  social web applications that are part of the ecosystem. Currently,
  notifications. API recommendations for managing subscriptions and friends lists
  are still being discussed.

  See component spec: [Linked Data Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/)

- **Recommendations for implementations**: for servers and clients.

  See component spec: [Recommendations for Server
  Implementations](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/recommendations-server.md).

  See component spec: [Recommendations for Client
  Implementations](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/recommendations-client.md).

## Querying

- [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL), a recursive acronym for SPARQL
  Protocol and RDF Query Language, is an RDF query language — that is, a semantic
  query language for databases — able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in
  Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.

[Ruben Verborgh](https://ruben.verborgh.org/) and [Ruben
Taelman](https://www.rubensworks.net/) and others are doing a lot to connect
GraphQL with Linked Data:

- Querying on a decentralized Web - Ruben Verborgh - GraphQL Day 2018.
  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUF7plExdv8) and
  [slides](http://slides.verborgh.org/GraphQL-Day-2018/).

- [Bridges between GraphQL and
  RDF (slides)](https://www.rubensworks.net/raw/slides/2019/w3c-data-ws-graphql-rdf/)

- [GraphQL-LD: Linked Data Querying with
  GraphQL](https://comunica.github.io/Article-ISWC2018-Demo-GraphQlLD/#query):
  In this article, we introduce GraphQL-LD, an approach that consists of a
  method for transforming GraphQL queries coupled with a JSON-LD context to
  SPARQL, and a method for converting SPARQL results to the GraphQL
  query-compatible response. We demonstrate this approach by implementing it
  into the Comunica framework. This approach brings us one step closer towards
  widespread Linked Data consumption for application development.

  Check out the code for the modules in the GraphQL-LD system:
  [graphql-to-sparql.js](https://github.com/rubensworks/graphql-to-sparql.js),
  [sparqljson-to-tree.js](https://github.com/rubensworks/sparqljson-to-tree.js).

- [HyperGraphQL](https://www.hypergraphql.org/): a GraphQL interface for
  querying and serving linked data on the Web. It is designed to support
  federated querying and exposing data from multiple linked data services using
  GraphQL query language and schemas. The core of the response is a
  [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) object, which extends the standard JSON with
  the JSON-LD context enabling semantic disambiguation of the contained data.

  seems to be its [home page](http://comunica.linkeddatafragments.org/) and [main
  GitHub repo](https://github.com/comunica/comunica).

- [Linked Data Fragments](http://linkeddatafragments.org/concept/) is a
  conceptual framework that provides a uniform view on all possible interfaces to
  RDF, by observing that each interface partitions a dataset into its own specific
  kind of fragments.

  A Linked Data Fragment (LDF) is characterized by a specific selector (subject
  URI, SPARQL query, …), metadata (variable names, counts, …), and controls (links
  or URIs to other fragments).

  Group](https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/) discusses implementations of
  libraries for working with RDF and Linked Data in ECMAScript platforms like Web
  browsers and Node.js

- ["Designing a Linked Data developer
  experience"](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2018/12/28/designing-a-linked-data-developer-experience/)
  provides a great overview of
  [LDflex](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/LDflex), a JavaScript DSL for
  querying Linked Data on the Web. It presents an
  [application](https://solid.github.io/ldflex-playground/) including [LDflex
  for Solid](https://github.com/solid/query-ldflex/) and [Comunica for
  LDflex](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/LDflex-Comunica). Cool stuff.
