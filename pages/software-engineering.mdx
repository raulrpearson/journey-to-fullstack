## Pair programming

Tuple.app has a great [guide on pair
programming](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide/). As its name implies,
this practice entails programming in pairs (and sometimes groups). The premise
is that this produces better code.

From [The Art of
Agile](https://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/pair_programming.html):

> It's more fun than it sounds: two programmers at one computer. One drives; the
> other navigates. Switching roles fluidly, they constantly communicate.
> Together, they accomplish better work more quickly than either could alone.
>
> The driver types. She focuses on tactics--writing clean code that compiles and
> runs. The navigator focuses on strategy--how the code fits into the overall
> design, which tests will drive the code forward, and which refactorings will
> improve the entire codebase.
>
> Pairs self-organize by selecting partners who can best help with the current
> task. They switch every few hours to share perspectives and knowledge.

Even if it seems inefficient to use two people to do the work of one, it works
out in the long run. Pair programming involves two roles: the driver and the
navigator. In simple term, the driver writes code and the navigator supports
this process by paying attention and making suggestions and asking questions.

By having a second pair of eyes looking at the code writing process, bugs, bad
decisions and distractions are reduced and code quality goes up. Producing
better quality code on the first try becomes more efficient.

The [recommended way to
start](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide/your-first-pairing-session) with
pair programming is to do it with someone nice, when you're feeling fresh and
comfortable, by working on something simple. This first taste is more about
learning how to pair program than reaping all the benefits from the get go.

Also, use the following
[template](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide/template):

1. Agree on the high-level goal out loud.
2. Break the work into a handful of tasks and prioritize them.
3. Decide your driver/navigator swapping strategy.
4. Configure git to share credit.
5. Eliminate distractions.
6. Work.
7. Analyze the session with a mini retro.
