## Redis

From the [intro page](https://redis.io/topics/introduction):

Redis is an open source in-memory data structure store, used as a database,
cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes,
lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial
indexes with radius queries and streams.

It has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and
different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via
Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing an element to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking
in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an in-memory
dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the
dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.
Persistence can be optionally disabled, if you just need a feature-rich,
networked, in-memory cache.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave asynchronous replication, with
very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection with partial
resynchronization on net split.

You can get a feel for Redis with this [Try Redis](http://try.redis.io/) site.

The most [popular applications of
Redis](https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/how-to/top-5-redis-use-cases/) are:

- Session cache in web applications, saving state of the current user session
  like contents of cart, settings, etc.

- Full Page Cache (FPC) for improving the speed of server generated websites.
  For example, [wp-redis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/) is a plugin to
  use Redis to speed up WordPress sites.

- Queues can be implemented easily with the API provided by Redis. As an
  example,
  [Celery](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html)
  provides a Redis backend for their task queue solution.

- Leaderboards/counting: again, Redis offers great utilities and API to make
  these applications easy to build. In this case, sorted sets, helps with any kind
  of ranked list of unique elements.

- Pub/Sub: same same, great utilities and API.
