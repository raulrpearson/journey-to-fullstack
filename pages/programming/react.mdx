## React as a UI runtime

Dan Abramov posted this [great overview of
React](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/).

Some programs output numbers. Other programs output poems. Different languages
and their runtimes are often optimized for a particular set of use cases, and
React is no exception to that.

**React programs usually output a tree that may change over time**. Let's call
this the host tree, because it's part of the host environment, like DOM or iOS.
It usually has it's own imperative API (`appendChild()` in DOM, for example).

React can be more performant by assuming that the host tree is _stable_ (not
changing too much over time) and _regular_ (can be broken down in components an
patterns). In the case of most UIs, these reasonable assumptions are correct.

A _host instance_ is a node in the _host tree_. Host instances have properties
and can have other host instances as children. As mentioned above, there usually
exists an API to manipulate these host instances.

A _renderer_ teaches React to talk to a specific host environment and manage its
host instances. React renderers can work in _mutating_ or _persistent_ mode.
Mutating mode is what you'd expect (host instances are completely mutable) and
persistent mode is for host environments that don’t provide methods like
`appendChild()` but instead clone the parent tree and always replace the
top-level child.

In the host environment, a host instance (like a DOM node) is the smallest
building block. In React, the smallest building block is a _React element_.
React element is a plain JavaScript object that can _describe_ a host instance:

```javascript
// JSX is a syntax sugar for these objects.
// <button className="blue" />
{
  type: 'button',
  props: { className: 'blue' }
}
```

A React element is lightweight and has no host instance tied to it. Again, it is
merely a description of what you want to see on the screen. They are immutable.
If you want to render something different later, you will describe it with a new
React element tree created from scratch. They are like frames in a movie.

Each React renderer has an _entry point_. It’s the API that lets us tell React
to render a particular React element tree inside a container host instance. For
example, in React DOM, `ReactDOM.render` is the entry point:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  // { type: 'button', props: { className: 'blue' } }
  <button className="blue" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

React’s job is to make the host tree match the provided React element tree. The
process of figuring out what to do to the host instance tree in response to new
information is sometimes called reconciliation.

When `ReactDOM.render` is called is called twice with the same container, React
needs to decide when to update the existing host instance to match a the React
element, and when to create a new one.

An example:

```jsx
// let domNode = document.createElement('button');
// domNode.className = 'blue';
// domContainer.appendChild(domNode);
ReactDOM.render(
  <button className="blue" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);

// Can reuse host instance? Yes! (button → button)
// domNode.className = 'red';
ReactDOM.render(
  <button className="red" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);

// Can reuse host instance? No! (button → p)
// domContainer.removeChild(domNode);
// domNode = document.createElement('p');
// domNode.textContent = 'Hello';
// domContainer.appendChild(domNode);
ReactDOM.render(<p>Hello</p>, document.getElementById('container'));

// Can reuse host instance? Yes! (p → p)
// domNode.textContent = 'Goodbye';
ReactDOM.render(<p>Goodbye</p>, document.getElementById('container'));
```

This raises a question of identity. The React element may be different every
time, but when does it refer to the same host instance conceptually? React is
quite smart and figures things out most of the time but with dynamic lists, it
needs a little help.

This is why React nags you to specify a special property called key every time
you include an array of elements in your output. A key tells React that it
should consider an item to be conceptually the same even if it has different
positions inside its parent element between renders.
