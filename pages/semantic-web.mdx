# Semantic Web

## Introduction

Manu Sporny has a bunch of very approachable
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/msporny/videos) on the basics of semantic
web and linked data.

## Microformat

A [microformat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat) (sometimes
abbreviated Î¼F) is a World Wide Web-based approach to semantic markup which uses
HTML/XHTML tags supported for other purposes to convey additional metadata and
other attributes in web pages and other contexts that support (X)HTML, such as
RSS. This approach allows software to process information intended for end-users
(such as contact information, geographic coordinates, calendar events, and
similar information) automatically.

Works by adding agreed upon semantic information inside regular HTML attributes,
like so:

```html
<div class="h-resume">
  <span class="p-name">
    <a class="p-contact h-card" href="http://example.org">
      <img src="http://example.org/photo.png" alt="" />
      Joe Bloggs
    </a>
    resume
  </span>

  <p class="p-summary">
    Joe is a top-notch llama farmer with a degree in
    <span class="p-skill">Llama husbandry</span> and a thirst to produce the
    finest wool known to man.
  </p>
</div>
```
