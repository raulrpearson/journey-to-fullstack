# Semantic Web

## Introduction

Manu Sporny has a bunch of very approachable
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/msporny/videos) on the basics of semantic
web and linked data:

- [What is linked data?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x_xzT5eF5Q)
- [What is JSON-LD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vioCbTo3C-4)
- [RDFa basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldl0m-5zLz4)
- [JSON-LD: Compaction and
  Expansion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm3fD89dqRE)
- [JSON-LD: Core Markup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvWk_TQ30A)

They are a bit outdated, but they're an easy watch.

Two-Bit History has a [great
article](https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html) on the history
of the semantic web and linked data. It might help you put the different
technologies into perspective.

## Random takeaways

From [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25888436):

- The semantic web is founded upon RDF. RDFa is an RDF serialization. Microdata

[Yoast uses JSON-LD](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/microformats-and-schema-org/)

## Microformat

A [microformat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat) (sometimes
abbreviated Î¼F) is a World Wide Web-based approach to semantic markup which uses
HTML/XHTML tags supported for other purposes to convey additional metadata and
other attributes in web pages and other contexts that support (X)HTML, such as
RSS. This approach allows software to process information intended for end-users
(such as contact information, geographic coordinates, calendar events, and
similar information) automatically.

Works by adding agreed upon semantic information inside regular HTML attributes,
like so:

```html
<div class="h-resume">
  <span class="p-name">
    <a class="p-contact h-card" href="http://example.org">
      <img src="http://example.org/photo.png" alt="" />
      Joe Bloggs
    </a>
    resume
  </span>

  <p class="p-summary">
    Joe is a top-notch llama farmer with a degree in
    <span class="p-skill">Llama husbandry</span> and a thirst to produce the
    finest wool known to man.
  </p>
</div>
```
