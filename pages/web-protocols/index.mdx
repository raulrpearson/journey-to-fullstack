## APIs to study

There's [a ton of them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). Here
the ones that I'm coming across most often:

- [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), although
  check out
  [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest),
  since that is how it used to be done.

- [Server-sent
  event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)

- [Service Worker
  API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
