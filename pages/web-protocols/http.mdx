## HTTP

### How does HTTP work?

The best resource I found is this Quora answer to [How does HTTP
work?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-HTTP-work/answer/Charles-Knouse-2). In
summary, when you input a URL into your browser's location bar and press enter,
this is typically and loosely what happens:

- Using DNS, the [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) is resolved into an IP
  address.

- A TCP connection is established with the web server answering at that IP
  address. Alternatively, a TLS-encrypted TCP connection is established if using
  HTTPS.

- HTTP messages are exchanged, the browser sends _requests_ and the server sends
  back _responses_. It starts with a GET request for the document referenced by
  the URL but many more request/response pairs are exchanged to load all of the
  different resources that make up a particular web page.

- Tali Garsiel and Paul Irish's famous [How Browswers
  Work](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/) give
  some details about the way browsers process the HTTP responses to render a
  particular web page.

- The video [How do web browsers work? | Web Demystified, Episode

  nice overview.

### Exercises

- Add details of the [HTTP request
  methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) to your

- Build a low level library that is able to compose and send HTTP requests and
  spit out HTTP responses.
