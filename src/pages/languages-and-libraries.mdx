### Drawing with CSS

Learn how to draw things with CSS. [Wenting
Zhang](https://twitter.com/DesignJokes) has this great video where she gives an
[introduction to drawing with CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNKz3devFAw).
She created an [icon set in CSS](https://cssicon.space/), which doubles as a
great learning resource.

She mentions that she decided to create CSS Icon because she wanted to leverage
CSS animations. What I don't understand about the whole drawing with CSS
movement is why not use SVG instead.

I looked into this because I had been seeing many examples of people drawing
amazing things on CodePen using CSS. I was blown away by this [Simpson's
collection](https://codepen.io/collection/DrwLdN).

Drawing something with CSS can be a lot of fun and a great deliberate practice
for a subset of CSS that we might not get to practice that much otherwise:

- Borders and shadows
- Positioning and transforms
- Animations
