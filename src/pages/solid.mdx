# Solid

[Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/) (Social Linked Data) is a web decentralization
project led by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. The project:

> aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in
> true data ownership as well as improved privacy

by developing a platform for linked-data applications that are completely
decentralized and fully under users' control rather than controlled by other
entities.

Solid's central focus is to enable the discovery and sharing of information in a
way that preserves privacy. A user stores personal data in "pods" (personal
online data stores) hosted wherever the user desires. Applications that are
authenticated by Solid are allowed to request data if the user has given the
application permission.

A user may distribute personal information among several pods; for example,
different pods might contain personal profile data, contact information,
financial information, health, travel plans, or other information. The user
could then join an authenticated social-networking application by giving it
permission to access appropriate information in a specific pod.

The user retains complete ownership and control of data in the user's pods: what
data each pod contains, where each pod is stored, and which applications have
permission to use the data.

## Specification overview

[Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/intro-to-solid-spec) is a proposed set of
conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on
[Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) principles. Solid
is modular and extensible. It relies as much as possible on existing W3C
standards and protocols.

- **Identity**: Solid uses
  [WebID](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/identity/) URIs as
  universal usernames or actor identifiers. WebIDs provide globally unique
  decentralized identifiers, enable cross-service federated signin, prevent
  service provider lock-in, and give users control over their own identity.

- **Profiles**: the WebID URI's primary function is to point to the location of a
  public WebID Profile Document. Solid uses these for management of user identity
  and security credentials (such as public keys), and user preferences
  discovery. Profiles are used by many actor types like users, groups,
  organizations, devices and software applications.

  A WebID URI, when dereferenced, yields a WebID Profile Document in a Linked
  Data format (Turtle by default, but often available as JSON-LD or HTML+RDFa).
  Parsing this document provides a client application with useful information,
  such as the user's name and profile image, links to user preferences and
  related documents, and lists of public key certificates or other relevant
  identity credentials.

  See component spec: [Solid WebID Profiles
  Specification](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/solid-webid-profiles.md).

- **Authentication**: the process of determining a user’s identity. Applications
  usually manage authentication with usernames and passwords as well as a recovery
  mechanism using typically email.

  Solid currently uses
  [WebID-TLS](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/) as its primary
  authentication mechanism. Alternative complementary mechanisms are also being
  actively investigated. In addition, Solid recommends that server
  implementations also offer secondary authentication available for users for
  Account Recovery (via email or some other out-of-band mechanism).

  See component spec: [Solid WebID-TLS
  Specification](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/authn-webid-tls.md).

  The Solid team is currently implementing support for WebID-OIDC as another
  primary authentication mechanism. It is based on the OAuth2/OpenID Connect
  protocols, adapted for WebID based decentralized use cases.

  See component spec: [WebID-OIDC
  Specification](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec).

  There are several other authentication mechanisms that are currently being
  investigated, such as combinations of traditional username-and-password
  authentication and WebID-TLS Delegation.

  Regardless of the primary authentication mechanism, bearer tokens and other
  proofs of identity tend to get lost by users. Passwords can be forgotten,
  browser certificates can be lost to hardware failure, and so on. Solid
  recommends that secondary Account Recovery mechanisms are provided by server
  implementers, to aid in these scenarios.

- **Authorization and access control**: the process of deciding whether a user
  has access to a particular resource. Solid currently uses the Web Access
  Control (WAC) mechanism for cross-domain authorization for all its resources.

  See component spec: [Solid WAC
  Specification](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec).

- **Content representation**: Solid deals with reading and writing two kinds of
  resources: Linked Data resources (RDF in the form of JSON-LD, Turtle, HTML+RDFa,
  etc.) and everything else (binary data and non-linked-data structured text).
  you can build Solid applications with non-linked data resources, using actual
  RDF-based Linked Data provides you with considerable benefits in terms of
  interoperability with the rest of the Solid app ecosystem.

  See component spec: [Solid Content
  Representation](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/content-representation.md).

- **Reading and writing resources**: Solid extends the [Linked Data
  Platform](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) spec to provide a simple REST API for CRUD
  operations on resources and containers. Solid also provides a WebSockets based
  API for a PubSub (Publish/Subscribe) mechanism, through which clients can be
  notified in real time of changes affecting a give resource.

  See component spec: [HTTPS REST
  API](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/api-rest.md).

  See component spec: [WebSockets
  API](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/api-websockets.md).

- **Social web app protocols**: Solid provides a number of specs and
  recommendations to help developers achieve interoperability between various
  social web applications that are part of the ecosystem. Currently,
  notifications. API recommendations for managing subscriptions and friends lists
  are still being discussed.

  See component spec: [Linked Data Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/)

- **Recommendations for implementations**: for servers and clients.

  See component spec: [Recommendations for Server
  Implementations](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/recommendations-server.md).

  See component spec: [Recommendations for Client
  Implementations](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/recommendations-client.md).
