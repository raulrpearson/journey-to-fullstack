## Environment variables

[This
article](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/making-your-node-js-work-everywhere-with-environment-variables-2da8cdf6e786)
makes a case for environment variables.

### Why?

Because they externalize all environment specific aspects of your app and
keep your app encapsulated. Now you can run your app anywhere by modifying the
environment variables _without changing your code and without rebuilding it_!

### When?

Some examples:

- Which HTTP port to listen on
- What path and folder your files are located in, that you want to serve
- Pointing to a development, staging, test, or production database
- URLs to server resources
- CDNs for testing vs. production
- Even a marker to label your app in the UI by the environment it lives in

### How?

- Using the local environment (duh) and/or command line. We're talking about
  _environment_ variables, after all. They could be present in memory as part of
  the execution context or you can pass them through the command line. Assuming
  you use bash:

```bash
PORT=8626 node server.js
```

- Using .env file. Keeps things tidy and convenient and avoids typing mistakes.
  I also think the previous solution has a higher risk of leaking data to the
  environment. When you add a variable to bash, other processes might be able to
  access that value. When you use dotenv, I think the variables are attached to
  your application process and can only be seen by it.

In any case, just use dotenv. Add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` and you
also have a convenient way of keeping your secrets accessible and (somewhat)
protected.

Read the [dotenv docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for details on how
to use it. I've seen two different ways of accessing values:

1. Using the dot notation: `process.env.PORT`
2. Using the bracket notation: `process.env['PORT']`

I'm assuming they're equivalent and who cares, but I like bracket notation
better. It would make it easier to use them programmatically like this:

```javascript
const keys = ['PORT', 'ENDPOINT', 'SECRET'];
for (key of keys) {
  let value = process.env[key];
  // do something with value
}
```

For consistency, why not use that notation everywhere.

Also follow the recommendation of a single .env file per environment. From [The
Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config):

> In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal
> to other env vars. They are never grouped together as “environments”, but
> instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales
> up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
