## React as a UI runtime

Dan Abramov posted this [great overview of
React](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/).

Some programs output numbers. Other programs output poems. Different languages
and their runtimes are often optimized for a particular set of use cases, and
React is no exception to that.

**React programs usually output a tree that may change over time**. Let's call
this the host tree, because it's part of the host environment, like DOM or iOS.
It usually has it's own imperative API (`appendChild()` in DOM, for example).

React can be more performant by assuming that the host tree is _stable_ (not
changing too much over time) and _regular_ (can be broken down in components an
patterns). In the case of most UIs, these reasonable assumptions are correct.

A _host instance_ is a node in the _host tree_. Host instances have properties
and can have other host instances as children. As mentioned above, there usually
exists an API to manipulate these host instances.

A _renderer_ teaches React to talk to a specific host environment and manage its
host instances. React renderers can work in _mutating_ or _persistent_ mode.
Mutating mode is what you'd expect and persistent mode is for host environments
that don’t provide methods like `appendChild()` but instead clone the parent
tree and always replace the top-level child.

In the host environment, a host instance (like a DOM node) is the smallest
building block. In React, the smallest building block is a _React element_.
React element is a plain JavaScript object:

```javascript
// JSX is a syntax sugar for these objects.
// <button className="blue" />
{
  type: 'button',
  props: { className: 'blue' }
}
```

A React element is lightweight and has no host instance tied to it. Again, it is
merely a description of what you want to see on the screen. They are immutable.
If you want to render something different later, you will describe it with a new
React element tree created from scratch. They are like frames in a movie.

Each React renderer has an _entry point_. It’s the API that lets us tell React
to render a particular React element tree inside a container host instance. For
example, in React DOM:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  // { type: 'button', props: { className: 'blue' } }
  <button className="blue" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```
