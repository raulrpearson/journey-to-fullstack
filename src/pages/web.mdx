## Loading fonts

To read: [Web Font
Optimization](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/webfont-optimization).

[This
article](https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d)
gives a great overview of strategies to improve the loading of Google Fonts.
Some of the tips apply to fonts in general.

We typically load Google Fonts by adding this piece of markup:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Muli:400"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

That returns a stylesheet full of `@font-face` declarations like this one:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Muli';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Muli Regular'), local('Muli-Regular'),
    url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/muli/v12/7Auwp_0qiz-afTzGLQjUwkQ1OQ.woff2)
      format('woff2');
  unicode-range: U+0100-024F, U+0259, U+1E00-1EFF, U+2020, U+20A0-20AB,
    U+20AD-20CF, U+2113, U+2C60-2C7F, U+A720-A7FF;
}
```

This tries to load fonts locally if they're available, before going to
`fonts.gstatic.com`. That's not too bad, specially considering that Google's
severs are good, but we have a couple of problems with this approach:

1. We're performing a minimum of 2 separate requests to different hosts -
   first for the stylesheet at `fonts.googleapis.com`, and then to a unique URL
   for each font hosted at `fonts.gstatic.com`.

2. We have no control over flash-of-invisible-text (FOIT) and
   flash-of-unstyled-text (FOUT) while fonts are loading. Setting the
   `font-display` property in the `@font-face` would give us that control, but
   it’s defined in the Google Fonts stylesheet.

3. Finally, while rare, if Google Fonts is down, we won’t get our fonts. If our
   own CDN is down, then at least we are consistently delivering nothing to our
   users, right?

Two strategies are suggested. At the very least, warm up the DNS lookup, TCP
handshake, and TLS negotiation to `fonts.gstatic.com` with `preconnect`:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com/" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Muli:400"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Alternatively, self-host. Use
[google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) and
follow instructions.

“Modern Browsers” will give you WOFF and WOFF2 formats while “Best Support” will
also give you TTF, EOT, and SVG. A reasonable option is to chose to only host
WOFF and WOFF2 while selecting system fonts as fallbacks for older browsers.

In your pages, use `preload` for fonts that you're sure you'll be using:
"Preload is a declarative fetch, allowing you to force the browser to make a
request for a resource without blocking the document’s onload event." ([Preload,
Prefetch And Priorities in
Chrome](https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf)).

All the browsers that support `preload` also support WOFF2 so we can safely
choose only WOFF2.

```html
<link
  rel="preload"
  as="font"
  type="font/woff2"
  href="./fonts/muli-v12-latin-regular.woff2"
  crossorigin
/>

<link
  rel="preload"
  as="font"
  type="font/woff2"
  href="./fonts/muli-v12-latin-700.woff2"
  crossorigin
/>
```

- `rel="preload"` tells the browser to declaratively fetch the resource but not
  “execute” it (our CSS will queue usage).

- `as="font"` tells the browser what it will be downloading so that it can set
  an appropriate priority. Without it, the browser would set a default low
  priority.

- `type="font/woff2` tells the browser the file type so that it only downloads
  the resource if it supports that file type.

- `crossorigin` is required because fonts are fetched using anonymous mode CORS.

If you’re okay with FOUT, or flash of unstyled text, then we can fix FOIT by
adding `font-display: swap;` to our `@font-face` declarations. More info in [this
glitch](https://font-display.glitch.me/). It explains the use of the
`font-display` property:

- Font loading follows three stages: block, swap, failure.

- `font-display` is applied per font-face.

- `font-display: block` produces FOIT but is good in cases where your font
  branding is important and you don't want people to see you site with fallback
  fonts.

- `font-display: swap` produces FOUT, the text is shown immediately in the
  fallback font until the custom font loads.

- `font-display: fallback` somewhere in between block and swap. The text is
  invisible for a short period of time (100ms). Then if the custom font hasn't
  downloaded, the text is shown in a fallback font (for about 3s), then swapped
  after the custom font loads.

- `font-display: optional` like fallback but the browser can decide to not use
  the custom font at all, based on the user's connection speed.

[subfont](https://github.com/Munter/subfont) is a command line tool to optimize
your webfont loading. Aggressive subsetting based on your font use, self-hosting
of Google fonts and preloading. If you're cool, you use Gatsby and life's good:
there's [a plugin for
that](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-subfont).
