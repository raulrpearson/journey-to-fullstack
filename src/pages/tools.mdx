### Git

#### Understanding `upstream`

GitHub tells you to use `git push -u origin master`. [This SO
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37770744) gives some insight into what
upstream is and why that is required.

Some of my takeaways:

- An upstream is simply another branch name, usually a remote-tracking branch,
  associated with a (regular, local) branch.
- Each branch can have 0 or 1 upstream.
- Setting an upstream is convenient becaues then many git commands can be used
  without arguments to produce expected results (i.e. `fetch`, `merge`,
  `rebase`, `pull`, `status`)
- `push` = `fetch` followed by `merge` or `rebase`
