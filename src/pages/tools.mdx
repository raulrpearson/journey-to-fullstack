### Understanding `upstream`

GitHub tells you to use `git push -u origin master`. [This SO
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37770744) gives some insight into what
upstream is and why that is required.

Some of my takeaways:

- An upstream is simply another branch name, usually a remote-tracking branch,
  associated with a (regular, local) branch.
- Each branch can have 0 or 1 upstream.
- Setting an upstream is convenient becaues then many git commands can be used
  without arguments to produce expected results (i.e. `fetch`, `merge`,
  `rebase`, `pull`, `status`)
- `push` = `fetch` followed by `merge` or `rebase`

## npm

- Understand and write about npm, npx, ncu, package.json, etc.

## Bundlers

In the context of web applications, bundlers are tools that transform your
source files to make them optimized for deployment. I think that mainly means
smaller size and less network requests, but it also includes things like
managing the transformation of things like SASS (good to have in development)
into CSS (required in deployment).

These are some popular bundlers:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)

Here's a
[comparison](https://medium.com/js-imaginea/comparing-bundlers-webpack-rollup-parcel-f8f5dc609cfd)
of Webpack, Parcel and Rollup. I'm currently debating myself between Webpack and
Parcel. Webpack is everywhere, but Parcel seems to provide a better DX. I think
I'll try to focus on Parcel for now and be ready to move to Webpack depending of
how they both evolve.

Some of the features to understand bundlers:

- Configuration. I honestly don't see what the big deal is, but it is nice to
  have as zero-config as possible. It seems Parcel provides the lowest config
  requirement.

- Entry points. Where does the bundler start parsing to do it's thing. I like
  that parcel provides an `index.html` entry point out of the box.

- Transformations. SASS to CSS, for example. Added with plugins. Again, Parcel
  seems to handle the most without plugins.

- Tree shaking. Eliminating dead code. Not supported by Parcel yet.

- Dev server. Watching for changes to your source files and automatically
  rebuilding your bundles.

- Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Being able to reload parts of your running app
  without having to reload the whole app. Speeds up development.

- Code splitting. Creating bundles that are broken up into different parts.
  Improves UX by requiring a smaller initial download. The user can start using
  the app while the rest of it is being fetched in the background.
