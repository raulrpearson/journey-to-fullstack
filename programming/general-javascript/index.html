<em>specification</em> of which JavaScript is the most popular <em>implementation</em> (other
implementations are JScript, ActionScript and Google Apps Script).</p><p>The ES6 is ECMAScript version 6, published in June 2015. It seems that since
then, Ecma International has released a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions">new version every
June</a>, so in June 2018 we had
ES9.</p><p>If you&#x27;ve got time, Auth0 did a nice review of <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-javascript/">JavaScript
history</a>:</p><ul><li><p>In the early days, Netscape, founded by Marc Andreessen, wanted to add dynamic
features to the web. They came up with Mocha, which was to become a scripting
language for the web. Simple, dynamic, and accessible to non-developers.</p></li><li><p>They brought in Brendan Eich with the promise of developing &quot;Scheme for the
browser&quot; (a dialect of <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Lisp</a>). Time pressure, the
rising popularity of Java and Netscape&#x27;s relationship with Sun Microsystems
ended in &quot;a premature lovechild of Scheme and Self, with Java looks&quot;.</p></li><li><p>The Mocha prototype was integrated into Netscape in May 1995 and renamed
LiveScript until December 1995 when it settled on JavaScript.</p></li><li><p>JavaScript made such a considerable difference in user experience that
competing browsers had no choice but to come up with a working solution, a
working implementation of JavaScript.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft called theirs JScript. The first version of JScript was included
with Internet Explorer 3.0, released in August 1996.</p></li><li><p>Brendan Eich rewrote Mocha to clean up the mess produced by the rushed
release. The JavaScript engine in Netscape was named
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey">SpiderMonkey</a>,
and that has been carried over to Firefox to this day
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a> came out of Netscape).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/">Brendan Eich</a>: &quot;Iâ€™m happy that I
chose Scheme-ish first-class functions and Self-ish (albeit singular)
prototypes as the main ingredients. The Java influences, especially y2k Date
bugs but also the primitive vs. object distinction (e.g., string vs. String),
were unfortunate.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Ecma International is an industry association formed in 1961 concerned solely
with standardization of information and communications systems.</p></li><li><p>Work on the standard for JavaScript was started in November 1996. The
identification for the standard was ECMA-262 and the committee in charge was
TC-39.</p></li><li><p>The second version of the standard, ECMAScript 2, was released to fix
inconsistencies between ECMA and the ISO standard for JavaScript (ISO/IEC
16262), so no changes to the language were part of it. It was released in June 1998.</p></li><li><p>AJAX, asynchronous JavaScript and XML, was a technique that was born in the
years of ECMAScript 3. Although it was not part of the standard, Microsoft
implemented certain extensions to JavaScript for its Internet Explorer 5
browser. One of them was the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> function (in the form of the
XMLHTTP ActiveX control). This function allowed a browser to perform an
asynchronous HTTP request against a server, thus allowing pages to be updated
on-the-fly. Although the term AJAX was not coined until years later, this
technique was pretty much in place.</p></li><li><p>Work on ECMAScript 4 was fraught with strong differences within the committee.
Some wanted to add big changes and features that would make JS more powerful,
others thought that shouldn&#x27;t be the path for JS. The work became so big and
stretched out that ES4 was abandoned.</p></li><li><p>If you are already familiar with ECMAScript 6/2015 you will notice that many
features from ECMAScript 4 were reintroduced in it.</p></li><li><p>All in all, ECMAScript 4 took almost 8 years of development and was finally
scrapped. Adobe was in favor of many of the features that were included in ES4
and they created ActionScript implementing those.</p></li><li><p>In the year 2009 ECMAScript 3.1 was completed and signed-off by all involved
parties. ECMAScript 4 was already recognized as a specific variant of
ECMAScript even without any proper release, so the committee decided to rename
ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript 5 to avoid confusion.</p></li><li><p>All-in-all, ECMAScript 5 was a modest improvement that helped JavaScript
become a more usable language, for both small scripts, and bigger projects.
Still, there were many good ideas from ECMAScript 4 that got scrapped and
would see a return through the ECMAScript Harmony proposal.</p></li><li><p>The ECMAScript Harmony proposal became a hub for future improvements to
JavaScript. Many ideas from ECMAScript 4 were cancelled for good, but others
were rehashed with a new mindset. ECMAScript 6, later renamed to ECMAScript
2015, was slated to bring big changes.</p></li><li><p>The release of ECMAScript 2015 caused a big jump in the use of transpilers
such as Babel or Traceur. Even before the release, as these transpilers
tracked the progress of the technical committee, people were already
experiencing many of the benefits of ECMAScript 2015.</p></li><li><p>A new release process implemented by TC-39. All new proposals must go through
a four stage process. Every proposal that reaches stage 4 has a strong chance
of getting included in the next version of ECMAScript (though the committee
may still opt to push back its inclusion). This way proposals are developed
almost on their own (though interaction with other proposals must be taken
into account). Proposals do not stop the development of ECMAScript. If a
proposal is ready for inclusion, and enough proposals have reached stage 4, a
new ECMAScript version can be released.</p></li></ul><h3 id="var-let-const"><a href="#var-let-const" aria-label="var let const permalink" class="anchor"></a><code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>const</code></h3><ul><li><p>Scope: <code>var</code> is function scoped, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are block scoped, which is
more restrictive.</p></li><li><p><code>var</code>s can be redeclared, even if it&#x27;s not clear why you&#x27;d do that.</p></li><li><p>Using <code>let</code> to redeclare a variable is not allowed in general, but inside a
narrower scope it is.</p></li><li><p>Using <code>const</code> on objects means the object shape cannot change, but the value
of it&#x27;s fields can. On arrays I&#x27;m not sure what it provides, probably that it
has to remain an Array object. I can edit, add and remove elements from the
<code>const</code> array. <code>Object.freeze()</code> can be used to make an object immutable.</p></li><li><p>Before <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>, people used
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE">IIFE</a>&#x27;s to limit the
scope of <code>var</code>s. Now, you can just use <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> inside a curly
brackets <code>{ ... }</code></p></li><li><p>These pieces of code illustrate more advantages of <code>let</code> vs <code>var</code>. After 5
seconds, this will print out &#x27;Number is 10&#x27; ten times:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-javascript">for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i += 1) {
  console.log(i);
  setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(`Number is ${i}`), 5000);
}
</code></pre><p>Versus this, which will print out &#x27;Number is 1&#x27;, &#x27;Number is 2&#x27;, etc.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i += 1) {
  console.log(i);
  setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(`Number is ${i}`), 5000);
}
</code></pre><ul><li><p><code>let</code> and <code>const</code> also solve the temporal dead zone. I.e. they will throw an
error if you reference them before declaring them. <code>var</code>s on the other hand,
return undefined in that scenario.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://wesbos.com/is-var-dead/">Is <code>var</code> dead?</a>. My takeaway: use <code>const</code> by
default, <code>let</code> when you need rebinding, don&#x27;t use <code>var</code>.</p></li><li><p>Three main benefits from arrow functions: conciseness, implicit return, no
